# Task Manager Backend

Simple Node/Express backend for a Task Manager application.

Quick start

1. Copy `.env` from a secure source (do NOT commit it).
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the server:

```bash
npm start
```

Notes

- This repo contains a `.env` with secrets — remove or rotate any exposed credentials.
- `.gitignore` is present to avoid committing `node_modules` and `.env` files.
